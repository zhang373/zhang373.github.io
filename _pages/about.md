<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Nice to meet you! I am Wenshuo ZHANG (张文硕), currently a Ph.D. student in HKUST VisLab, at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Prof. Huamin Qu and working with Dr.Linping Yuan.       

Before joining HKUST, I obtained my B.S. degree in Automation, the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, FYP supervised by Prof. Lei CHEN and Dr. Zhao CHEN at HKUST Guangzhou in 2024. I also obtained a dual Bachelor's degree in Accounting (ACCA Track), the Management School, Xi'an Jiaotong University, FYP supervised by Prof. Hong ZHAO in 2024. During my UG study, I went to the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Hong Kong as a government-sponsored exchange student and worked with Prof. Xiaojuan QI there.    

My research interest lies in **Human LLM Alignment in Multi-round Dialog / Agentic System**, including (1) accessing LLM's internal pattern to regularize users' behaviours to meet LLM input needs, (2) learning and modeling users' behaviours to do post-training on LLM to overcome users' shortages, and (3) data augmentation and evaluation to support the bidirectional alignment. If you are interested in cooperating with me, feel free to drop me an email. Let's go together to **Make the Impossible Possible and the Possible Easy**.

[Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Great Bay Area Regional Earth System Digital Twin Project](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ghdBcgAd1y-rqB4GLlanWQ)

- 60 million HKD form RGC@HK, 1.4 million for us
- Responsible for part "Neuro Network and Distillation Based Ocean Data Compression for Visualization Acceleration". Developed a machine learning-based compression framework to enable real-time, interactive VR visualization of large-scale scientific data. This innovation addressed significant latency issues by compressing daily data files from over 6 GB to a highly efficient 6.75 MB model, reducing data processing and rendering time to just 0.75 seconds on Nvidia 3070.

[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Digital Twin Smart Campus](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ghdBcgAd1y-rqB4GLlanWQ)

- The project aims to create a comprehensive digital twin platform that integrates diverse data on campus, aiming to enhance the convenience and interactivity of campus life for students and faculty. The project monitors crowd dynamics and facility status in real time while ensuring user privacy through core features such as augmented reality exploration, gamified sustainability, social interaction and smart navigation. The platform integrates cafeteria information, course scheduling, activity information, social assistance, and environmental data monitoring, and provides data support for campus management through mobile apps, VR, and large-screen displays to create an intelligent and efficient learning and living environment.
